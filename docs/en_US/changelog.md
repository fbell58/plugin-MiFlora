* Choice of the hci in the config, very useful if the hci0 is assigned to an exclusive plugin or if it does not manage the Bluetooth BLE
* Choice of the Bluetooth security level to solve the problems of some dongles that do not manage the high level

### Ideas for the following versions:

* Manage other brands than Xiaomi for plants (Parrot)
* Manage multiple remote devices and associate them with devices to increase the Bluetooth port by adding multiple receivers
* Add the config test: hci and sec-level must be filled
* Choice of error log or info in case of connection problem after 4 tests
* Test that macadd is <> between Equipments (glue copy error)
* Test the Bluetooth status and restart it if there is a problem (sudo hciconfig hci0 down, sudo hciconfig hci0 up) for example the error error error: Connection refused (111)
* Cause data recovery right after adding the hardware? or a command to force the update
* Button to detect a new MiFlora (avoid finding the address by hand)

This list of questions comes primarily from your questions on the forum's MiFlora thread.
